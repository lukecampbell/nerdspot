There is nothing quite like that thrill, when you've been hacking away at a problem for a while and in that singularity when everything comes together in one beautiful compilation. Working with multiple people, in multiple teams on multiple modules can be extremely frustrating and incredibly challenging. I offer a few observations that have aided me in the past couple of weeks.

* Choose an arbiter for your team.
  - Have someone who can be the focal point to interact with outside members if possible. 

* Use git
  - Git has saved countless hours of pain and suffering.
  - Git has also CAUSED several hours of pain and headache because of our lack of understanding on how to use it best.

* Set short achievable goals
  - Make frequent short term achievable goals that move in the right direction
  - Start with unit testing / TDD
  - After the pieces are implemented, start focusing on integration and integration testing.

* Don't run independent ops
  - Going off on your own without anyone knowing what you're working on can truly be miserable for everyone!
